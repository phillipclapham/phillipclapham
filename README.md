# 👋 Hey, I'm Phill

By day: Senior Solutions Architect at Pressable -> helping teams succeed with WordPress
By night: Building the missing layer between humans and AI -> building the future of AI memory and conversational continuity

Currently shipping:
- **FlowScript** - Infrastructure for AI memory and cognitive symbiosis. Structured notation that compiles to queryable knowledge graphs with provenance tracking. Think git for thought. After 6 months: emergent intelligence we call the Third Mind.
- **Protocol Memory** (coming soon) - The memory and continuity layer AI assistants are missing

The thesis: language = consciousness = reality. Shared topological language enables genuine human-AI partnership. We're testing whether this creates something genuinely new -> Research papers + open source launch soon
