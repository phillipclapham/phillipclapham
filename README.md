# 👋 Hey, I'm Phill

By day: Senior Solutions Architect at Pressable, helping teams succeed with WordPress
By night: Building the missing layer between humans and AI

Currently shipping:
- **FlowScript** - Bridging the language bottleneck in AI communication
- **Protocol Memory** (coming soon) - The memory and continuity layer AI assistants are missing

The thesis: AI didn't democratize intelligence, it revealed a bottleneck. Working to fix that.
